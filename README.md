# Best-Neighbour-Algorithm-for-Routing-Traffic

Worked in a team of 5 to design and implement an intelligent traffic routing simulation based on a custom Best Neighbour Algorithm for Routing Traffic (BNART). The project modeled a multi-agent transportation system where a Central Traffic Control Unit (CTCU) optimized vehicle paths across a randomized 20-node road network.
